DOC
`into` is the engine of much of shades' magical goodness. It takes either a string or object 
(or function) and turns it into a useful function. All of shades [collection functions](#collection-transformations)
will automatically pass their inputs into `into`, creating a useful shorthand.

The transformation follows one of the following 3 rules:
* a **function** is returned as is (easy enough)
* a **string** or **number** is converted into a lens accessor with [`get`](#get)
* an **object** is converted into a predicate function using the function [`has`](#has). This one is the most interesting, and
requires some explanation.

In the simplest form, a pattern of keys and values will produce a function that takes a test 
value and returns `true` if the given test value has at least the equivalent keys and values 
of the pattern. Using the [store](#store) example from above:

```js
// Tests if an object passed to it has the key goldMember mapped to true
> const isGoldMember = into({goldMember: true})
> isGoldMember(jack)
false

// test multiple values
> into({goldMember: true, name: "Elizabeth Swan"})(liz)
true
```

Nested values work just as you'd expect:
```js
> into({jack: {goldMember: false}})(store.byName)
true
```

Where it REALLY gets interesting is when the _values_ in your pattern are predicate functions. 
In this case, the value at that key in the test object is passed to the function, and validation 
only continues if that function returns `true`

```js
// Tests if the object passed to it has a title attribute that is less than 50 letters long
> const hasShortTitle = into({title: title => title.length < 50})
> hasShortTitle(jack.posts[0])
false
```
This pattern is especially useful with [lenses and traversals](#guide)

USE
expectType<number>(into('a')({a: 10}))
expectError(into('b')({a: 10}))
expectType<boolean>(into({a: 10})({a: 10}))
expectError(into({a: 10})({b: 10}))
expectType<number>(into((x: number) => x + 1)(10))

TEST
it('should use into to create functions', () => {
  into('a')({ a: 10 }).should.equal(10);
  into({ a: 10 })({ a: 10 }).should.be.true;
  into(x => x + 1)(10).should.equal(11);
});

export const into = (f) => do {
  if (typeof f === 'function') f;
  else if (typeof f === 'object') has(f);
  else get(f);
};

export default into;
